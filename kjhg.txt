TerraLuma Capital — What We Need to Know (Website Planning Summary)
1. Core Identity

TerraLuma Capital is a purpose-driven private investment firm.

Core value: Invest and serve with purpose.
This is not marketing language — it’s the firm’s decision filter.

Implications for the site:

Tone: grounded, ethical, long-term, non-speculative

No hype, no “beat the market” language

Emphasis on stewardship, continuity, and responsible capital

2. Who TerraLuma Is For (Primary Audience)

Accredited investors only.
This should be clear early and repeated calmly.

Ideal investor profile:

High-net-worth individuals

Seeking predictable income (12–15%)

Prefers private markets over public equities

Values tangible assets and downside awareness

Comfortable with $500k minimum, 36-month term

Website goal for investors:

Build trust

Educate

Qualify

Push to 1:1 call, not instant signup

3. What TerraLuma Does (Business Model)

Acquires and operates real assets and businesses in private markets.

Three asset classes:

Private Businesses

Land

Flex / Light Industrial Real Estate

Key differentiators:

Direct sourcing (no auctions, no broker feeding frenzy)

Operates where institutions don’t (sub-institutional deals)

Focused on cash flow + long-term value, not speculation

4. Investor Economics (Must Be Very Clear)

Two income structures:

12% annual interest — paid monthly

15% annual interest — paid quarterly

Important clarifiers (site should highlight):

True annual interest (not “target”)

No management fees

Not tied to stock market performance

Fixed income structure

Minimum: $500,000
Term: 36 months

IRA note:

Self-Directed IRAs and Solo 401(k)s allowed

TerraLuma helps guide conversion

5. Risk Philosophy (Trust Builder)

TerraLuma does not claim to be risk-free.

Core positioning:

Public markets = concentration + systemic risk

TerraLuma = real assets, operating history, essential demand

Security narrative:

Tangible collateral

Proven cash-flowing businesses

Conservative acquisition criteria

Regional focus for operational control

This section should feel adult, honest, and sober — not defensive.

6. Asset Criteria (Operational Credibility)

Private Businesses

7+ years operating history

$500k–$5M average net profit

Verifiable financials

Clear operational upside (marketing, systems, tech)

Land

Bought < 50% of retail lot value

Road frontage

Power + water access

Perc/soil viable

Minimal flood exposure

Usable topography

Flex / Light Industrial

Blue-collar / service tenants

Value-add opportunities

High-demand growth markets

Phase I environmental completed

7. Geographic Focus (Why These Markets)

Southeastern U.S.:

Nashville

Huntsville

Knoxville

Chattanooga

Why this matters for the site:

Migration inflows

Business-friendly climates

Trades + logistics demand

Development pressure supporting land value

Strong small-business ecosystems

This supports both investor confidence and seller relevance.

8. The Macro Thesis (Education Sections)

Two major tailwinds TerraLuma is built around:

A. Land Ownership Transition

300–350M acres transferring over ~20 years

Aging landowners, weak succession

Scarcity + development pressure

Institutions largely absent at this scale

B. Small Business “Silver Tsunami”

Millions of Baby Boomer–owned businesses exiting

~48% of owners actively planning exit

Many lack succession plans

Creates acquisition opportunities with real cash flow

These sections should:

Educate

De-risk the strategy

Justify long-term relevance

9. Seller-Facing Side (Second Audience)

TerraLuma also speaks to business owners and landowners.

Seller value props:

Fast, certain cash closes

Seller financing options

Creative structures

Confidential, relationship-driven process

Clear CTAs:

“Tell us about your business”

“Get a fast, fair land offer”

“Submit your property for evaluation”

This should feel approachable, not institutional.

10. Conversion Strategy (Critical)

No frictionless investing. No dashboards. No public deals page.

Primary CTAs:

“Schedule a call”

“Start a confidential conversation”

“See if this is a fit”

Website flow:

Establish trust

Explain philosophy

Show discipline

Qualify the visitor

Push to conversation
