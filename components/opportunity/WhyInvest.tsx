                The TerraLuma Income Fund is designed as a fixed-income offering
                that provides capital to support asset acquisitions and
                operations. This fund prioritizes both principal protection and
                consistent monthly cash flow.

                durable value for our investors.

                value clarity, alignment, and long-run outcomes.
